This project solves a sudoku puzzle given a starting configuration. The program 
utilises recursion to find the single unique solution to the puzzle using digits 1-9, if 
one exists. The project contains a configuration file, practice.dat, as an example of how 
to format a starting configuration (whether valid or invalid).

This project was completed as part of the MSc Computing at Imperial College London.
