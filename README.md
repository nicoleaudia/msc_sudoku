This project solves a sudoku puzzle given a starting configuration. The program 
utilises recursion to find the single unique solution to the puzzle using digits 1-9, if 
one exists. The project contains 3 configurations for testing -- easy, medium, and hard -- 
with difficulty determined by how much the recursive functionality must be used in order 
to solve the puzzle (or test all potential configurations, with no final solution).

This project was completed as part of the MSc Computing at Imperial College London.
