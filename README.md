This project solves a sudoku puzzle given a starting configuration. The program 
utilises recursion to find the single unique solution to the puzzle using digits 1-9, if 
one exists. The project contains dat files with various starting configurations: Easy, 
medium, and hard were used during testing and are named according to difficulty determined 
by how much the recursive functionality must be used in order to solve the puzzle (or test 
all potential configurations, with no final solution). The mystery dats do not give 
indication of their difficulty. The practice dat can be modified by the user for testing.

This project was completed as part of the MSc Computing at Imperial College London.
